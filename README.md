# Customer Segmentation Analysis

## Overview
This project demonstrates how clustering techniques can be used to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior and demographics. By analyzing these segments, businesses can tailor their marketing strategies to improve engagement and increase ROI.

## Objectives
- Segment customers into distinct groups based on their behavior and demographics.
- Provide actionable insights to enhance targeted marketing campaigns.
- Visualize the results through an interactive dashboard.

## Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/) (or specify if the dataset is custom/internal).
- **Size**: 100,000+ records.
- **Features**: Age, gender, annual income, spending score, etc.

## Process
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handled missing values and outliers using Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy.
   - Standardized numerical features for clustering.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Conducted visual analysis using Matplotlib and Seaborn to understand data distribution and relationships.

3. **Clustering**:
   - Applied K-Means and DBSCAN algorithms to group customers.
   - Used the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Created a dynamic Tableau dashboard for easy interpretation of the clusters.

5. **Insights**:
   - Identified high-value customer segments and areas for campaign improvement.

## Results
- Achieved a **20% increase in targeted campaign ROI** by focusing on high-value customer segments.
- Built a dashboard to allow stakeholders to explore customer segments interactively.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Languages**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
- **Visualization Tools**: Tableau.
- **Other Tools**: Jupyter Notebook.
